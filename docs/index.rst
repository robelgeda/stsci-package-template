Documentation for WebbPSF
===============================

WebbPSF is a Python package that computes simulated PSFs for the JWST instruments (and now for WFIRST too), taking into account detector pixel scales, rotations, filter profiles, and point source spectra. It is *not* a full optical model of JWST, but rather a tool for transforming optical path difference (OPD) maps, created with some other tool, into the resulting PSFs as observed with JWST's instruments.

**What this software does:**

* Uses OPD maps precomputed by detailed optical simulations of JWST and WFIRST, and in the case of JWST
  based on instrument and telescope flight hardware cryo-vacuum test results.
* For JWST, computes PSF images with requested properties for any of JWST's instruments. Supports imaging, coronagraphy, and most spectrographic modes with all of JWST's instruments. IFUs are yet to come.
* For WFIRST, computes PSFs with the Wide Field Imager, based on recent GSFC optical models, including field- and wavelength-dependent aberrations. 
  A preliminary version of the Coronagraph Instrument is also available.
* Provides a suite of tools for quantifying PSF properties such as FWHM, Strehl ratio, etc.

**What this software does NOT do:**

* Contain in itself any detailed thermal or optical model of JWST or WFIRST. For the results of end-to-end integrated simulations of JWST, see for instance `Predicted JWST imaging performance (Knight, Lightsey, & Barto; Proc. SPIE 2012) <http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1362264>`_. For WFIRST modeling, see `the WFIRST Reference Info page <http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/Instrument_Reference_Information.html>`_
* Model spectrally dispersed PSFs produced by any of the spectrograph gratings. It does, however, let you produce monochromatic PSFs in these modes, suitable for stitching together into spectra using some other software.
* Model detector effects such as pixel MTF, intrapixel sensitivity variations, interpixel capacitance, or any noise sources. Add those separately with your favorite detector model code. (\*Note, one particularly significant
  detector scattering for MIRI imaging has now been added.)

**Contributors:**
WebbPSF has been developed by Marshall Perrin, Joseph Long, Neil Zimmerman, Robel Geda, Shannon Osborne, and Marcio Melendez Hernandez, with contributions from Jarron Leisenring, Ewan Douglas, Charles Lajoie, Megan Sosey, and the developers of  the astropy-helpers template framework.

Getting Started with WebbPSF
----------------------------

The WebbPSF software system is composed of two Python packages: a lower-level optical propagation library (:py:mod:`POPPY <poppy>`) plus an implementation of the JWST instruments using that library (:py:mod:`WebbPSF <webbpsf>`).  This documentation explains the programming interfaces and graphical user interface of WebbPSF, as well as providing a :ref:`quick overview <poppy_overiew>` of POPPY.

.. admonition:: Quickstart Jupyter Notebook

   This documentation is complemented by an `Jupyter Notebook format quickstart tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mperrin/webbpsf/blob/master/notebooks/WebbPSF_tutorial.ipynb>`_. Downloading and running that notebook is a great way to get started using WebbPSF.
